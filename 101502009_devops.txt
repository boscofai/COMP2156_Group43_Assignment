COMP 2156- DevOps For System Administration

In this course students will learn the procedures, protocols and best practices that a DevOps engineer
brings to a workplace environment to increase productivity. Analyze and evaluate various developer
operation implementations available and implement hands-on work using industry standard toolkit.
Create solution to complex business problem by adhering to the core responsibilities of DevOps
Students will learn about data formats and types, including Extensible Markup Language (XML),
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Yaml Ain't Markup Language (YAML), and Yet Another Next
Generation (YANG), and their value in network automation, along with DevOps tools such as Ansible
and Git.

Courses Deliverables 

1. Effectively carry out the roles of a System or Network engineer with DevOps processes by
utilizing the industry-standard tools and techniques and strategies such as CI/CD, as well as
software development lifecycle and containerization for deployment.
2. Demonstrate the strategies and skills of using suitable DevOps tools, Cloud database
technologies and techniques for software/network applications
3. Enhance the software development life cycle cycle through cross collaboration among the IT
staff by understanding and effectively automating the application configurations and operations.
4. Utilize Version Control System workflows to develop optimized, low-risk software releases and
continuous code integration.
5. Make a well-informed analysis and architectural decisions between monolithic or microservice
architecture for software products.
6. Monitor code quality and CI/CD pipelines to improve and optimize the DevOps processes
continuously
7. Create effective strategies and utilize service platforms such as Infrastructure as Code and the
benefits of cloud computing to deploy a software product.
8. Identify the market and opportunities for a DevOps Engineer to Effectively develop & integrate
security practices into the software development cycle and CI/CD pipelines.


Why this course matters
This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to
business needs. COMP 2156 will provide a hands-on experience through the
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies.
We will also examine ways in which companies have either lost or saved fortunes
with DevOps strategies. Learning about Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker and
Travis CI, you will become familiar with end-to-end deployment processes. You will
also have your very own build pipeline which will allow you to push changes to a
web app in the wild at the stroke of a key.
Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to
ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they produce
some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & communication
heightened across all teams. Looking at the software development lifecycle
through the lens of a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified
developer.
