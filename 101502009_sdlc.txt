DevOps-Importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle.

1. Faster Process due to Automation – With the help of DevOps, we can make the SDLC process in a genuine agile manner for the timely releases of the product. In earlier days, Development Team and Operations teams worked in different silos. So, at that time, it was a challenging task to identify whether the application was ready for operation or not. But now, in DevOps, the development and operation teams work together. So, the application is prepared in a much faster time. It happens in DevOps due to the various phases involved in the process and multiple tools. With the help of these tools, we can implement the CI/CD process so that whenever a developer pushes any code changes in the master branch, it automatically starts the process of building the application for error-checking purposes. If required, we can implement the Continuous Deployment process in this. It is much more critical for companies to succeed in the current substantial competitive market. AT Amazon, engineers are deploying code every 11.7 seconds on average with the help of the DevOps Process.

2. Save Time and Cost – By using DevOps, companies can save time-related to software development and reduce the cost of the process against the entire system. Every software development team generally consists of different team members per technical expertise like excellent, good, average, and poor. So, for any application, removing any harmful code written by the developers during the process is much more essential. Otherwise, it will impact the application's performance or disturb the user end's functionality. And at that time, the developer needs to fix that issue and follow the entire development and deployment process again. But if we can identify those wrong codes during the development time, we do not need any extra time to fix the issue. DevOps exactly do the same as a process. DevOps helps us reduce inadequate code limits. If those are not rectified, then DevOps will not allow moving the code to the next level. This way, we can save time for the development process and reduce the cost-effectively.

3.Improve Product Quality – With the help of DevOps, we can increase the efficiency level of the Developer, so it automatically helps speed up the development process and provide a much more error-free product at the end. To reduce the number of errors in the product or increase the Product quality before final delivery, we can use different tools and processes like Automate Testing of Code. In addition, it will help us to implement the continuous integration process. This process runs automatically with every code change push and tries to identify if there is any issue in the system due to these code changes. So, in the end, the delivered application has a higher quality than earlier.

4.Quick Release Process – Using DevOps can improve the Software Development culture within the development team. In this process, both the development and operational team combined to perform a combined board, and as a result, the output of the process will appear more quickly and efficiently. As a result, the unit can focus on delivering the product to launch the application much more rapidly. Also, in this process, after deploying the product, the team can gather product feedback from stakeholders or end-users. Then, according to can adopt those suggestions, make the changes, and rerelease them.

5.Lower Chance of Failure - The primary reason behind the deployment failure is the application's programmatic error. As in DevOps, the development cycles are short. So, more frequently, the process prompts the code release build and helps us identify the defects in the code. In this way, the chance of deployment failure has been reduced.

6.New Career Job Role – Nowadays, DevOps is a much more trending technology in the job market. There is a lot of job requirement for DevOps-related technical professional. But currently, there are not enough technical persons available who can fill the roles and responsibilities of DevOps. So, it helps anybody a great advantage who wants to be a DevOps professional to get a good job role.

7.High PayScale for DevOps Professionals – In the current industry, DevOps Professionals' salary packages are much higher than the other Job roles with the same experience level.

8.Expertise in multiple technical tools - In DevOps, several phases are involved in completing the process. So, in those processes, we can use different tools. It gives us reasonable control and expertise on the various technical tools like:
Git
Jenkins
Docker
Kubernetes
Selenium
Puppet
Ansible
Chef
And many more
