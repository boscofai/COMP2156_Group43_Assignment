The software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) are combined into a coherent framework by 
the constantly evolving principles and set of practices known as DevOps. Its primary objective is to 
enhance and expedite the software development process by promoting cooperation between 
the operations and development teams. 

The development and operations lifecycle, from planning, building, and deployment to testing, 
monitoring, and iterating, is encompassed by DevOps. Communication, transparency, adaptability,
and automation are essential for DevOps. Fundamentally, DevOps is a cultural revolution that 
encourages cross-functional teams to work together, communicate, and integrate.

It promotes ideas that support quick and dependable software delivery, including automation, 
infrastructure as code (IaC), continuous integration, and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD).  
DevOps creates a unified approach by removing silos.  It unifies the historically separate roles of 
development and operations by coordinating goals, processes, and toolchains, allowing for a more 
streamlined, effective workflow.
